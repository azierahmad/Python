# 1- Basic - I will Print all integers from 0 to 200.

# for i in range(0,201,1):
#     print(i)
# print("------------")

# 2- Multiples of Five - I will Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 500.

# for z in range(0,501,5):
#     print(z)
# print("------------")

# 3- Counting, the Azier Ahmad Way - I will Print integers 1 to 100. and If divisible by 5, print "Azier" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Azier Ahmad".

# for m in range(1,101):
#     if m%10 == 0:
#         print(m,"Azier Ahmad")
#     elif m%5 == 0:
#         print(m, "Azier")
#     else:
#         print(m)
# print("------------")

# 4- i will Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.

# sum = 0
# for r in range(1,500000,2):
#     sum +=r
# print(sum)
# print("------------")

#5- Countdown by Fours - I will Print positive numbers starting at 2020, counting down by fours.

# for q in range (2020, 0, -4):
#     print(q)
# print("------------")

#6- Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines)

# lowNum = 2
# highNum = 9
# mult = 3
#
# for p in range(lowNum, highNum+1):
#     if p%mult == 0:
#         print(p)
# print("------------")
